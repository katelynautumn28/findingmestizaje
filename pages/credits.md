I extend my most sincere thanks to the following Texas archival repositories which processed my digitization requests and granted me permission to display their digitized collection items on this site: 
- Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection, University of Texas at Austin
- Cushing Memorial Library and Archives, Texas A&M University
- African American History Research Center, Houston Public Library
- Albert and Ethel Herzstein Library, San Jacinto Museum and Battlefield Association
- Catholic Archives of Texas, Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops
- University of Texas at Arlington Special Collections

The initial research phase of this project was generously funded by the 2024 NYU Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowship. Thank you to Jojo Karlin, Nicholas Wolf, and Al√≠a Warsco for their valuable insights and support.
