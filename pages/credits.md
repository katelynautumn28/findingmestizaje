Hello! My name is Katelyn Landry and *Finding Mestizaje in the Archive* is my capstone project submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Archives and Public History at New York University. Please feel free to contact me with questions or comments about the project at landry.katelyn28@gmail.com.

I extend my most sincere thanks to the following Texas archival repositories which processed my digitization requests and granted me permission to display their digitized collection items on this site: 
- Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection, University of Texas at Austin
- Cushing Memorial Library and Archives, Texas A&M University
- African American History Research Center, Houston Public Library
- Albert and Ethel Herzstein Library, San Jacinto Museum and Battlefield Association
- Catholic Archives of Texas, Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops
- University of Texas at Arlington Special Collections

The initial research phase of this project was generously funded by the 2024 NYU Digital Humanities Graduate Fellowship. Thank you to Jojo Karlin, Nicholas Wolf, and Al√≠a Warsco for their valuable insights and support. 

I also received generous funding from the NYU Department of History which enabled me to pay for high quality digital reproductions of the collection materials featured on this site. 

Finally, I am grateful for the encouragement and feedback provided by Ellen Noonan, Director of the Archives and Public History MA program at NYU, as well as my brilliant peers in the APH program.
