*Finding Mestizaje in the Archive* is a digital humanities project that seeks to highlight persons identified as mixed-race in the archival record. Through collaboration with archival repositories in Texas, this project site presents newly digitized archival collection items that reveal various ways that mixed-race people were captured in the colonial-record keeping system. By connecting these disparate materials by the common thread of mixed-race identity, this project seeks to establish a material record of mestizaje that is often overlooked in U.S. archival collections.  

In addition to the digital collection, this project also includes key insights and data visualizations from *Finding Mestizaje in the Archive: A Qualitative Analysis of Archival Description of Race and Caste*, a research paper which analyzes the ways in which race is described and contextualized across 70 finding aids published by Texas archival repositories.

This project serves as a capstone project submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Archives and Public History at New York University.
