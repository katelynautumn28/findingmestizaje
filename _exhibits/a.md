The casta painting genre, popular in the 18th century in colonial Mexico, offers a visually striking manifestation of the Spanish elite’s obsession with documenting racial mixing  and its supposed causal relationship to one’s social and economic status in colonial society. The paintings typically depict several scenes, each with a man and a woman of different races with their mixed-race child, who is assigned a racial epithet that reflects the combination of their parents’ backgrounds. Those painted with darker skin to represent children of Indigenous and African backgrounds were usually depicted as being of lower socioeconomic station  than those who shared more recent European lineage. Mestizo, mulatto, criollo, castizo, morisco, and zambo are just a few examples of racial terms assigned to colonial subjects of mixed African, Indigenous, and European backgrounds.

The importance of giving attention to these terms is not simply to advocate for the addition of terms to the archivist’s repertoire of descriptive terminology. As Diana Taylor observes, “Though ostensibly grounded in notions of blood,” the categories that made up the casta system “actually focused more on… manner, dress, style, language, religion, and setting.”[^1] As the casta painting demonstrates, one’s casta also held meanings for socioeconomic status and even emotional or moral attitudes as represented by the differences in clothing, landscape, and the apparent tenderness or anger between family members. I’m curious whether these layers of racist and classist implications also exist in archival description, whether archivists directly cite the language of the colonialist racist record creator or through their own original description.
