This page displays some of the key findings from my analysis of EAD finding aids gathered from TARO.

## Visualizations

The majority of finding aids analyzed in this study were contributed by Texas universities (Figure 1). Finding aids published by the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of 
Texas at Austin are overrepresented in the corpus, with nearly half (30) of the finding aids under study generated from there. As a major special collections library with a subject focus on Latin America at a highly ranked research university, the Benson unsurprisingly emerges in this study as the state’s foremost repository for collections involving Black, Indigenous, and mixed-race archival subjects during the Spanish colonial period. While the Benson is the only specifically Latin American focused repository in the corpus, all of the universities represented in the study prioritize collections related to the Spanish colonial legacy in Texas, the Southwest, and Mexico.

Of the 27 finding aids that include colonial-era terms for describing mixed-race people and the racial caste system, 21 were produced by universities, 2 by government archives, 1 by a museum library, 2 by public libraries, 1 by a religious institution (Figure 2). The relatively low proportion of the corpus including those descriptive terms demonstrates what was perhaps obvious at the outset of this study: mixed-race subjects are not particularly prominent in archival collections, even those related to colonial administration of the Americas. Still, within this case study, universities emerge as the clear locus of archival description of mestizaje.

By analyzing the levels of description across the corpus, results show that the majority of finding aids have received considerable amounts of archival labor to be described at the folder and item levels (Figure 3). Based on the high amount of detailed descriptive work that has evidently been undertaken with collections in the corpus, I would assert that a lack of description, contextualization, or indexing of racial terminologies cannot simply be attested to minimal processing or lack of sufficient resources.

By coding the collection date extents listed in the finding aid, I found that over half of the corpus represents collections mostly or completely dated after the period of New Spain’s independence, which has been established as the effective end of racial caste terminology in hegemonic record-keeping practices (Figure 4). The overrepresentation of post-colonial collections in the corpus limits the claims I am able to make about archival descriptive practices for colonial era collections, which one would expect would have a higher volume of racial caste terminology. However, by analyzing the co-occurrences of mestizaje and caste codes with era codes, I found that there are mestizaje and caste description occurs equally in collections with date extents before and after the independence era (Figure 5). Mestizaje terms, particularly mulatto/a, were already present in Anglo-American racial imaginary and often used in documents related to the economic operation of slavery in the US. Thus, archival descriptions of mestizaje are not necessarily confined or concentrated in the archival record of the Spanish colonial era.
