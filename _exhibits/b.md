This study treats finding aids as historical objects of rich textual data that will be analyzed through “tagging,” a method of qualitative data analysis often utilized in social science fields.  Also known as “coding” or “labeling,” tagging allows the researcher to identify concepts, themes, opinions, and sentiments across a collection of narrative data which may then be analyzed to determine patterns such as frequency and co-occurrence of tags across the corpus of data. My approach builds on several text analysis projects in which archivists investigate trends in archival description and encoding as a means to understand archivists’ approaches to representing archival collections and archival labor. EAD-XML tag analysis projects by Maureen Callahan and Lia Warner as well as Jennifer Douglas’s close reading of finding aids are particularly influential in establishing finding aids as important objects that demand rigorous study,  in addition to utilities for facilitating user access.[^1] Unlike Callahan and Douglas, Warner undertook a macro-analysis of 1000 finding aids, further expanding the potential to utilize computational data analysis to investigate a large number of finding aids to identify patterns in descriptive practices and archival labor. As my research progressed, I realized that I was not as interested in investigating descriptions of mixed-race subjects through the lens of EAD-XML schema, so I did not adopt a robust programming approach to the textual data that would have emphasized the role of EAD data elements, as Warner did. Additionally, I chose to utilize  qualitative analysis software that operated more smoothly with PDF documents, so I opted to investigate the finding aids through a more traditional mode of text analysis as opposed to computational data analysis.  
I gathered a corpus of 78 finding aids from TARO, a database of thousands of EAD finding aids contributed by over 80 archives and libraries across the state since 2001.[^2] I compiled this collection of finding aids by searching the following keywords that I expected might be included in records related to the racial caste system in Spanish colonial society: mestizo, mestiza, mulatto, mulatta, castizo, castiza, negro, negra, indio, india, Indian, creole, criollo, criolla, caste, and casta. I also searched categorical terms that I expected might have been added to these records’ descriptive metadata as subject headings or mentioned in historical/biographical and scope and content notes required by DACS (Describing Archives: A Content Standard): mixed race, race relations, interracial, biracial, and miscegenation. I limited the results of these keyword searches to those with start dates before 1900, since this study is focusing on the keywords’ semantic meanings during and immediately after the colonial period and excludes analysis of mestizaje as it was framed in the 20th century. Although racial caste terms were no longer employed by Mexico after it achieved its independence in 1821, I also wanted to account for any potential remnants of colonial perspectives on race that may have endured into the 19th century and became intertwined with Anglo-American conceptions of race as the latter sought to supplant Mexican hegemony during their colonization projects in Texas the Southwest US.  
After gathering over 100 finding aids based on these keyword searches, I navigated to the locations in the text where the keywords were found and removed finding aids in which the keyword was within the title of a written or creative work, a person’s name, or the name of a geographic location. Once the corpus was culled, I uploaded the finding aids as PDF documents to ATLAS.ti, a qualitative data analysis software typically used for coding and analyzing large bodies of textual documents such as transcripts & field notes. I developed two series of codes: the first series of codes are intended to flag racial descriptive terms that appear anywhere in the finding aid (Table 1). In addition to coding descriptions of mixed-race subjects, I also coded terms used to describe Black, Indigenous, and Spanish subjects who were not identified as mixed-race in the hopes of being able to discern differences in descriptive approaches to each racial group.

| Table 1: Coding description of race and caste |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Narrative description** | **Codes** |
| Colonial-era terms used to classify mixed-race people  | mestizo(s), mestiza(s), mulatto(s), mulato(s), mulatta(s), mulata(s), castizo, castiza |
| Colonial-era terms used to describe racial caste as a social hierarchy or racial imaginary | caste, casta, limpieza de sangre |
| Common terms used to generally describe Black people in the Americas. These terms remain in use well beyond the colonial era  | Black, African, negro (Spanish and English use), negra (Spanish use) |
| Common terms used to generally describe Indigenous peoples in the Americas. These terms remain in use well beyond the colonial era  | indio(s), india, indian(s) |
| Colonial-era terms used to classify Spaniards born in the New world | creole, criollo, criolla |
| Modern phrases referring to mixed-race groups  | mixed race, race relations, interracial, biracial |

	The second series of codes were intended to identify characteristics of the finding aids and collections they represented (Table 2). These codes were intended to help build an aggregate profile of the types of repositories, collections, and descriptive labor represented in the study. The comparison between these characteristics – especially the visibility of artificial arrangement and reparative description efforts – and the aforementioned codes for racial terminology were essential for understanding relationships between archival labor and their approaches to racial description.

| :---- | :---- |
| **Metric** | **Codes** |
| Evidence of archivists’ attempts to employ reparative or culturally sensitive language in order to make users aware of outdated or racist language within the collection  | reparative/aware |
| Date description was last revised | Codes developed based on dates of most recent processing or revision listed in the finding aids. If no date was present, finding aids were coded with “date unknown” |
| Era in which collection inclusive dates fall  | pre-independence, bulk pre-independence, revolutionary era, post-independence, bulk post-independence, both eras, no dates provided |
| Repository type | government, museum, public library, religious, university |
| Description level | series, box, folder, item, volume |
